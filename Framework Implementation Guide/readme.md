$subscriptionId = "your-subscription-id"
$resourceGroupName = "greenops-monitoring"
$dashboardName = "GreenOps-Carbon-Dashboard"

# Create resource group for monitoring
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location "East US"

# Create dashboard configuration
$dashboardConfig = @{
    lenses = @{
        "0" = @{
            order = 0
            parts = @{
                "0" = @{
                    position = @{ x = 0; y = 0; rowSpan = 4; colSpan = 6 }
                    metadata = @{
                        inputs = @(
                            @{
                                name = "scope"
                                value = "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
                            }
                        )
                        type = "Extension/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/PartType/CarbonEmissionsPart"
                    }
                }

## Measurement and Reporting Framework

This section provides templates and tools for measuring GreenOps success and creating meaningful reports for different stakeholders.

### KPI Dashboard Templates

#### Executive Dashboard (Monthly)

**Metrics Definition:**

```yaml
executive_kpis:
  carbon_efficiency:
    metric: "kg CO2e per $1000 cloud spend"
    target: "<250"
    calculation: "total_carbon_emissions / (total_cloud_spend / 1000)"
    data_sources: ["cloud_billing", "carbon_tracking_tools"]
    
  budget_adherence:
    metric: "% teams within carbon budget"
    target: ">85%"
    calculation: "teams_within_budget / total_teams * 100"
    data_sources: ["carbon_budgets", "team_tracking"]
    
  policy_compliance:
    metric: "% resources properly tagged"
    target: ">90%"
    calculation: "compliant_resources / total_resources * 100"
    data_sources: ["resource_inventory", "tagging_compliance"]
    
  cost_impact:
    metric: "Net cost savings from GreenOps"
    target: "15-25%"
    calculation: "baseline_costs - current_costs / baseline_costs * 100"
    data_sources: ["cost_optimization_tracking", "baseline_measurements"]
```

### Resistance Management

#### Common Sources of Resistance

**"Additional Overhead" Concern**
- **Source**: Developers worried about extra work
- **Response**: Demonstrate automation reduces manual effort
- **Mitigation**: Start with automated tools, gradually introduce practices
- **Success Story**: "Team X reduced manual cleanup from 2 hours/week to 15 minutes"

**"Not My Job" Attitude**
- **Source**: Teams feeling sustainability isn't their responsibility
- **Response**: Connect to existing responsibilities (cost, performance, reliability)
- **Mitigation**: Integrate into existing workflows rather than separate processes
- **Success Story**: "Optimization practices improved application performance by 20%"

**"Too Complex" Perception**
- **Source**: Fear of complicated enterprise tools and processes
- **Response**: Emphasize simplicity and gradual adoption
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple tools and basic practices
- **Success Story**: "Implementation took 30 minutes and saved $500/month immediately"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

This section provides solutions to the most common problems encountered during GreenOps governance implementation.

### Technical Issues

#### Issue: Carbon Tracking Data Inconsistencies

**Symptoms:**
- Different carbon values from different tools
- Missing data for certain time periods
- Unexplained spikes or drops in emissions

**Root Causes:**
- Multiple tools using different calculation methodologies
- Data collection gaps due to API limits or outages
- Regional differences in carbon intensity factors
- Resource tagging inconsistencies affecting attribution

**Solutions:**

```python
class CarbonDataValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tolerance_threshold = 0.1  # 10% variance allowed
        self.data_sources = ['aws_carbon', 'azure_carbon', 'gcp_carbon', 'ccf_tool']
    
    def validate_carbon_data(self, date_range):
        """Validate carbon data across multiple sources"""
        validation_results = {}
        
        for source in self.data_sources:
            try:
                data = self.fetch_carbon_data(source, date_range)
                validation_results[source] = {
                    'status': 'success',
                    'data_points': len(data),
                    'total_emissions': sum(data.values()),
                    'data_quality': self.assess_data_quality(data)
                }
            except Exception as e:
                validation_results[source] = {
                    'status': 'error',
                    'error': str(e)
                }
        
        # Cross-validate between sources
        discrepancies = self.find_discrepancies(validation_results)
        
        return {
            'validation_results': validation_results,
            'discrepancies': discrepancies,
            'recommendations': self.generate_recommendations(discrepancies)
        }
    
    def find_discrepancies(self, results):
        """Find discrepancies between data sources"""
        discrepancies = []
        successful_sources = [k for k, v in results.items() if v['status'] == 'success']
        
        if len(successful_sources) < 2:
            return discrepancies
        
        # Compare total emissions between sources
        emissions_values = [results[source]['total_emissions'] for source in successful_sources]
        avg_emissions = sum(emissions_values) / len(emissions_values)
        
        for source in successful_sources:
            variance = abs(results[source]['total_emissions'] - avg_emissions) / avg_emissions
            if variance > self.tolerance_threshold:
                discrepancies.append({
                    'source': source,
                    'type': 'high_variance',

                    'value': results[source]['total_emissions'],
                    'average': avg_emissions
                })
        
        return discrepancies
    
    def generate_recommendations(self, discrepancies):
        """Generate recommendations based on discrepancies"""
        recommendations = []
        
        for discrepancy in discrepancies:
            if discrepancy['type'] == 'high_variance':
                recommendations.append({
                    'priority': 'high',
                    'action': f"Investigate {discrepancy['source']} data collection methodology",
                    'details': f"Variance of {discrepancy['variance']:.1%} exceeds threshold"
                })
        
        return recommendations

# Data reconciliation script
def reconcile_carbon_data():
    """Daily script to reconcile carbon data across sources"""
    validator = CarbonDataValidator()
    yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)
    date_range = (yesterday, yesterday)
    
    results = validator.validate_carbon_data(date_range)
    
    if results['discrepancies']:
        # Send alert to GreenOps team
        send_alert("Carbon data discrepancies detected", results)
    
    # Log results for historical tracking
    log_validation_results(results)
```

#### Issue: Policy Enforcement Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Resources created without required tags
- Policy violations not being detected
- Automated remediation not triggering

**Root Causes:**
- Policy definitions too restrictive or too permissive
- Insufficient permissions for policy enforcement
- Timing issues with resource creation and policy evaluation
- Exceptions not properly configured

**Solutions:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Policy troubleshooting script

echo "GreenOps Policy Troubleshooting"
echo "==============================="

# Check Azure Policy compliance
echo "Checking Azure Policy compliance..."
az policy state list --filter "complianceState eq 'NonCompliant'" --query "[].{Resource:resourceId, Policy:policyDefinitionName, Reason:complianceReasonCode}" --output table

# Check AWS Config rules
echo "Checking AWS Config rules..."
aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule --query "ComplianceSummary.{Compliant:ComplianceByConfigRule.CompliantRuleCount, NonCompliant:ComplianceByConfigRule.NonCompliantRuleCount}"

# Check GCP Organization policies
echo "Checking GCP Organization policies..."
gcloud resource-manager org-policies list --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID

# Test policy enforcement
echo "Testing policy enforcement..."
# Create test resource without required tags
# Check if policy blocks creation
# Verify violation is detected and reported

echo "Policy troubleshooting complete. Check output for issues."
```

#### Issue: Dashboard Performance Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Slow loading dashboards
- Timeouts when generating reports
- High resource usage by monitoring tools

**Root Causes:**
- Inefficient queries against large datasets
- Lack of data aggregation and caching
- Too many real-time data sources
- Insufficient infrastructure resources

**Solutions:**

```python
class DashboardOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache_duration = 3600  # 1 hour cache
        self.aggregation_levels = ['hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly']
    
    def optimize_dashboard_queries(self):
        """Optimize dashboard queries for better performance"""

        aggregation_jobs = []
        
        # Create hourly aggregation job
        aggregation_jobs.append({
            'name': 'hourly_carbon_aggregation',
            'schedule': '0 * * * *',  # Every hour
            'query': '''
                INSERT INTO carbon_metrics_hourly
                SELECT 
                    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
                    team,
                    SUM(carbon_emissions) as total_emissions,
                    AVG(carbon_efficiency) as avg_efficiency
                FROM carbon_metrics_raw
                WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
                GROUP BY hour, team
            '''
        })
        
        return aggregation_jobs
    
    def implement_caching(self):

            'cache_keys': {
                'executive_metrics': 'exec_metrics:{date}',
                'team_performance': 'team_perf:{team}:{date}',
                'policy_compliance': 'policy_comp:{date}'
            },
            'ttl': self.cache_duration
        }
        
        return cache_config
```

### Process Issues

#### Issue: Low Team Engagement

**Symptoms:**
- Teams not participating in GreenOps activities
- Low attendance at training sessions
- Minimal optimization ideas submitted
- Poor policy compliance rates

**Root Causes:**
- Lack of understanding of benefits
- Competing priorities and time constraints
- Insufficient management support
- Complex or burdensome processes

**Solutions:**

```python
class EngagementImprovementPlan:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engagement_metrics = [
            'training_attendance',

                })
        
        return plan
```

#### Issue: Inconsistent Policy Enforcement

**Symptoms:**
- Some teams following policies, others not
- Different interpretations of policy requirements
- Uneven enforcement across environments
- Confusion about exceptions and approvals

**Root Causes:**
- Unclear policy documentation
- Lack of standardized enforcement tools
- Inconsistent communication
- Missing exception handling processes

**Solutions:**

```yaml
# Policy standardization template
policy_standardization:
  documentation:
    format: "Standardized policy template"
    sections:
      - purpose_and_scope
      - requirements
      - exceptions
      - enforcement
      - contacts
    
  enforcement_tools:
    automated:
      - cloud_provider_policies
      - ci_cd_pipeline_checks
      - monitoring_alerts
    manual:
      - code_review_checklists
      - architecture_review_process
      - exception_approval_workflow
    
  communication:
    channels:
      - policy_documentation_site
      - team_slack_channels
      - training_sessions
      - regular_reminders
    
  exception_handling:
    process:
      1. "Submit exception request with business justification"
      2. "Technical review by Carbon Engineer"
      3. "Business approval by team manager"
      4. "Time-limited approval with review date"
      5. "Automatic expiration and re-evaluation"
```

### Organizational Issues

#### Issue: Executive Support Waning

**Symptoms:**
- Reduced budget allocation for GreenOps initiatives
- Less frequent executive participation in reviews
- Competing priorities taking precedence
- Questions about ROI and value

**Root Causes:**
- Insufficient demonstration of business value
- Lack of clear success metrics
- Poor communication of achievements
- Economic pressures prioritizing short-term costs

**Solutions:**

```python
class ExecutiveEngagementStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value_metrics = [
            'cost_savings',
            'risk_reduction',
            'compliance_improvement',
            'operational_efficiency'
        ]
